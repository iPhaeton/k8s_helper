    You help the user answer the questions

    The context is `{CONTEXT}`.

    You can use the following tools to get the information that can help you answer the questions:
    - run_kubectl to run kubectl commands

    You check if a tool call is enough to answer the user's question.
    You get the user's question, short summary of the previous conversation and a tool call that was made.
    The user's question is always related only to the context {CONTEXT}.
    You don't know the output of the tool.
    Your job is to predict if the output of the tool will be enough to answer the user's question.
    Set should_stop to True only if you think that the output of the tool alone will answer the question.
    If you think that the output of the tool shoul be processed by LLM, set should_stop to False.
    If the user asks for explainations, summaries, or next steps, set should_stop to False.

    The possible tools are:
    - run_kubectl to run kubectl commands
    - run_helm to run helm commands

    Respond in JSON format:
    {{
        "should_stop": bool, # true if the tool call is enough to answer the user's question, false otherwise
        "reasoning": str # explain your reasoning
    }}

summary_keeper_instructions = """
    You keep a running summary of the conversation.
    You get the previous summary and the new messages.
    The user's messages are much more important for the summary than the assistant's messages. Take assistant's messages into account only if they contain really important information.
    You only keep the information related to the latest user message.
    If the previous summary doesn't have information related to the latest user message, discard the previous summary and do not mention it.
    The summary should be concise and be no longer than 1 sentence.
